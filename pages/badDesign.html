        <p><br>Each year, Apple comes out with a new phone that has everyone running to their local AT&T and Verizon stores. However, with the release of the new phones it seems like they don't ever change there software. One of the worst user-experieces that I have will using my personal phone is the timer on the clock app. While the software seems easy to use, it can also be really easy to mess up. </p><br>
        <p>The software requires for a user to use a scroll wheel to select how long the timer will last.</p><br>
        <img class ="overallScreen" src="../img/appleTimer.png" alt="Apple Timer">
        <br><p>As you can see, having both of the scroll wheels right next to each other can make it really easy for the user to misinput the wrong time on the timer. This error is something that I personally go through often as I use the timer a lot on my phone.</p>
        <p>The user interface for the iPhone timer trys to be way too simplistic and because of that it is really easy for misinputs to occur</p>
        <p>In order to make things easier on the user, I believe that it would be easier to allow the user to just input the amount of time they wish to be on the timer. This can be done with either requiring the user to type the amount of time or having buttons that the user would click on to have the correct time.</p>
